# Car Plate Recognition System
Software car plate recognition

This is the code I did as the thesis to request my bachelor's degree in Engineering of Systems in Bogota Colombia at the Francisco Jose de Caldas University.

I did this code in the 2009 year. Nowadays there is a lot of improvements can be made to this source code. For instance, use cumpy instead of numpy library to use the GPU instead of the CPU and increase in that way the processing speed. also, bigger and more templates can be included to increase the accurate identification of the characters on the car plate.
